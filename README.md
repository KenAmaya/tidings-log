# Tidings Log
My portfolio project for Codecademy's CS101
Tidings Log is a terminal program that will do the following:
+ **Ask for time** This can be an exact time on the clock, or the amount of hour/min/seconds.
+ **Show the countdown** The program will takeover a terminal session—much like what htop or Midnight Commander does—to show how much time is left and on what time will the countdown end.
+ **Ask for input** It should notify the user that the countdown has ended.
+ **Ask for notes** Here I can take notes on the things I did during that time period.
+ **Save the notes** to a file.
+ **Ask for time again** Loop back to step one.

These steps emulates the style of journaling that works for me. I have been doing it using pen and paper, but sometimes I'd like to edit what I've wrote, and integrating this to my terminal will be helpful for keeping my momentum whilst still keeping record.

# Project Objectives
The main goal is to meet the objectives for the Codecademy module:
+ Build a terminal program using Python
+ Add at least one interactive feature using input()
+ Use Git version control
+ Use the command line and file navigation
+ Write a technical blog post on the project

My personal objectives:
+ Learn how to create command line interfaces
+ Create something useful for me personally
+ Create something that can be added to a suite of tools that will help manage my focus and mental energy
